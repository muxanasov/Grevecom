Graphical Editor and Verifier for Context-Oriented Models is an Eclipse plugin. It allows you to draw you context-oriented model, verify it against environment evolutions and generate a source-code skeleton for your application.

The editor is in the very early stage of developing, thus there is no human-readable output of model-checker yet, only one generator of [ConesC](https://github.com/muxanasov/ConesC) source code, and a lot of bugs.

More updates and manuals are coming soon!
