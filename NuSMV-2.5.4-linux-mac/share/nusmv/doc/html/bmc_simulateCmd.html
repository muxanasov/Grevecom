<h3>bmc_simulate - Generates a trace of the model from 0 (zero) to k</h3>
<hr>
<code>bmc_simulate [-h] [-p | -v] [-r] [[-c "constraints"] | [-t "constraints"]</code><p>
bmc_simulate does not require a specification
  to build the problem, because only the model is used to build it.
  The problem length is represented by the <i>-k</i> command parameter,
  or by its default value stored in the environment variable
  <i>bmc_length</i>.<BR>
  Command Options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-p</tt>
       <dd> Prints current generated trace (only those variables whose value
       changed from the previous state).
    <dt> <tt>-v</tt>
       <dd> Verbosely prints current generated trace (changed and unchanged
       state variables).
    <dt> <tt>-r</tt>
       <dd> Picks a state from a set of possible future states in a random way.
    <dt> <tt>-c "constraints"</tt>
       <dd> Performs a simulation in which computation is restricted
       to states satisfying those <tt>constraints</tt>. The desired
       sequence of states could not exist if such constraints were too
       strong or it may happen that at some point of the simulation a
       future state satisfying those constraints doesn't exist: in
       that case a trace with a number of states less than
       <tt>steps</tt> trace is obtained. The expression cannot contain
       next operators, and is automatically shifted by one state in
       order to constraint only the next steps
    <dt> <tt>-t "constraints"</tt>
       <dd> Performs a simulation in which computation is restricted
       to states satisfying those <tt>constraints</tt>. The desired
       sequence of states could not exist if such constraints were too
       strong or it may happen that at some point of the simulation a
       future state satisfying those constraints doesn't exist: in
       that case a trace with a number of states less than
       <tt>steps</tt> trace is obtained.  The expression can contain
       next operators, and is NOT automatically shifted by one state
       as done with option -c
    <dt> <tt>-k steps</tt>
       <dd> Maximum length of the path according to the constraints.
       The length of a trace could contain less than <tt>steps</tt> states:
       this is the case in which simulation stops in an intermediate
       step because it may not exist any future state satisfying those
       constraints.
