<h3>bmc_simulate_check_feasible_constraints - Performs a feasibility check on the list of given constraints. Constraints that are found to be feasible can be safely assumed not to cause deadlocks if used in the following step of incremental simulation.</h3>
<hr>
<code>bmc_simulate_check_feasible_constraints [-h | -q] [-c "formula"]*</code><p>
This command generates feasibility problems for
  each constraint. Every constraint is checked against current state
  and FSM's transition relation, in order to exclude the possibility
  of deadlocks. Constraints found to be feasible can be safely assumed
  not to cause deadlocks if used in the following step of incremental
  simulation.<BR>

    Command options:<p>
    <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-q</tt>
       <dd> Enables quiet mode. For each analyzed constraint "0" is
       printed if the constraint is found to be unfeasible, "1" is
       printed otherwise. <BR>
    <dt> <tt>-c "formula"</tt>
       <dd> Provide a constraint as a <tt>formula</tt> specified on
            the command-line. This option can be specified multiple
            times, in order to analyze a list of constraints.<BR>
